# ChemNetworks

*ChemNetworks* is a completely generalized code that complements and dramatically expands upon our previously reported moleculaRnetworks series of R-scripts. As such, it can be used to understand a very large range of chemical systems that include complex solutions, liquid interfaces, self-assemblies, or pure liquids undergoing phase changes. This software converts .xyz coordinates to a graph/network based upon user-defined rules for intermolecular interactions "edges" between molecular "vertices". Subsequent analyses include degree census, network neighborhood, geodesics, lifetimes of geodesics of each length, and direct structural searches of specific network patterns. These properties can help to understand the network patterns and organization that may influence physical properties and chemical reactivity.

This is the C++ version of ChemNetworks, in active development.
